# minesweeper
This project is a recreation of Minesweeper. 
You will start off with Medium difficulty, but if you want, you can change it in the top left corner, by clicking on the difficulty and selecting the one you want.
To start the game and the timer, click on any tile you want. 
Left clicking will reveal the tile you are clicking, but be careful to not left click a bomb, because if you do, you lose!

Middle clicking will reveal all adjascent tiles to the one you're clicking, if there's equal amount of flags to the number of bombs near the tile you are clicking. It 
will also reveal a bomb, so make sure your flags are correctly placed.

Right clicking places a flag on the tile you're clicking. You can use flags to remember where the bombs are, and to be careful in those spots.
